## General info
In the beginning, this is an assignment of ITU Algorithm Analysis Course to handle big integers multiple. So divide and conquer  methods are suitable form to develop algorithms 
that have high dimensions and needed the resolution and is the best practice to learn how to analyze understanding algorithms flows.
In this assignment is about the evaluation of the two algorithms according to the given situation.
Classical Binary Multiply, the other is the Karatsuba Algorithm.


## Development Environment
This Project is written on CLion++  C++11 with Windows 10 Operating Sytstem. Also, 

The two algorithms required that are compared in terms of time according to Number of bits. 
The complexity of the algorithm is lower than Classical Method, and 
we benefit from time-saving "divide and conquer" method to show how the same work done in a shorter time.
